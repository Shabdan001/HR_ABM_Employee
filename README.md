# IBM HR Analytics: Employee attrition analysis

### Problem Statement:
The high rate of employee attrition can have significant implications for organizations, leading to increased recruitment and training costs, reduced productivity, and decreased employee morale.
It is crucial for companies to understand the underlying factors contributing to attrition and take proactive measures to address them.

### Project Objective:
The objective of this project is to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset using Python.
The goal is to gain insights into the factors influencing employee attrition and performance within the organization.
By examining various features and conducting statistical analysis, we aim to identify patterns, trends, and potential areas for improvement that can help the company better understand and manage employee attrition and performance.
